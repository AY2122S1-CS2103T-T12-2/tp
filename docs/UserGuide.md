WhereTourGo: A Tour Guide’s Best Friend!

**WhereTourGo (WTG)** is a desktop app for managing your tour contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The app helps the tour guides easily collate and access contacts of a variety of several services such as F&B, accommodations, attractions etc.

If you can type fast, WTG can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This User Guide will help you set up your contact list and familiarise yourself with the features of WhereTourGo.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Mandarin Oriental`.

* Items in **square brackets** are **optional**<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Mandarin Oriental t/hotel` or as `n/Mandarin Oriental`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/food`, `t/wine t/food` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
*Duplicate contact names are not allowed
  e.g. if there exists a contact named ‘Marina Bay Sands’, adding or editing a contact with the name ‘Marina Bay Sands’ is not allowed.<br>
